    title: "Create to Earn + DAO & Governance Setup",
    description:
      "Joining The Chosen Ones opens the door to a global network of like-minded people from all walks of life. Not only is our community filled with welcoming individuals who love to connect with newcomers, but our partners and founders have connections across a multitude of industries, making our network, your network. The DAO Accelerator program alows you as holders to help decide which projects we will bring on to help educate and build, in turn providing you with passive income. For the holders who have multiple pieces from our collection, are stakers, and also hold a digital card, you will have more power and priority in voting rights than others. The DAO governance structure we set in place will help The Chosen Ones gain valuable information on which projects have the most potential according to the community. To be able to participate in the decision-making process, one needs to vote on a project by using tokens that can be earned via staking or holding our Digital ATM Card. Holders are only able to vote for one project per wallet. The projects that receive the most votes are then selected for the accelerator program introductory call. We will then decide whether or not all the required materials and plans are set in place for the utmost success of the project, therefore, resulting in greater yield for our holders.",

      "From day one, we will be implementing a digital currency specifically developed within Discord, that will translate to the metaverse and all marketplace items added from The Chosen Ones. This allows our community, and our active, avid members who believe in the project, to earn this digital currency that they can then go on to use for specific giveaways, raffles, and metaverse items. Those who get in early will receive an often overused OG member role, but we will ensure this has true meaning by giving them access to our future master classes, events, and merchandise should they hold onto at least one of the NFT’s they mint.",
